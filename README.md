Overview

This project implements a scalable ETL pipeline that automates the following:

- Data Ingestion: Collecting raw retail sales data from diverse sources.
- Data Transformation: Cleaning, enriching, and restructuring data using Apache Spark and PySpark.
- Data Loading: Loading processed data into cloud data lakes and warehouses (AWS S3, Snowflake).
- Data Analysis: Enabling near real-time reporting and sales trend analysis.

Architecture

The pipeline follows a modular big data architecture:

- Data Sources: Raw sales data in CSV, JSON, or streaming formats.
- Ingestion Layer: AWS Glue jobs and PySpark scripts for batch/stream ingestion.
- Transformation Layer: Data cleansing, validation, and aggregation using Spark.
- Data Storage:
  - AWS S3 for staging and archiving.
  - Delta Lake and Snowflake for curated datasets.
- Orchestration: Apache Airflow for workflow management.
- Analytics & Reporting: Power BI dashboards and SQL queries.

Features

- Automated ETL with real-time and batch processing.
- High performance with 40% faster report generation.
- Data Quality & Validation to ensure reliability.
- Real-Time Sales Analytics through event-driven processing.
- Integration with AWS, Azure, and Databricks ecosystems.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- AWS account (with S3, Glue, IAM access)
- Snowflake or Delta Lake setup
- Git installed
- Apache Airflow (optional for orchestration)

Usage

Step 1: Prepare Data
Place raw sales files into data/raw/.

Step 2: Configure Jobs
Update AWS and Glue job configs in config/.

Step 3: Run ETL Scripts
Execute PySpark/Glue jobs in the scripts/ directory.

Step 4: Query & Analyze
Use SQL scripts or Power BI to analyze trends.
